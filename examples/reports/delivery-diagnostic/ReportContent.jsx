No real company research or live connector query is represented. The original question is “Why are more orders arriving late, and what should we fix first?”\n\nThe baseline covers June 22–July 19, 2026; the recent period covers July 20–August 16. Each includes four complete promised-delivery weeks. All eligible orders have final delivery scans by August 20. Express, pickup, split shipments, and orders placed after 16:00 are outside scope.\n\n**Calculation:** for each failure stage, scale the baseline late-order count by ${number(totals.orders)} ÷ ${number(totals.beforeOrders)}, then subtract that expected count from the recent count. The separate volume contribution applies the baseline late rate to the additional orders. This accounting split does not predict the effect of an intervention.\n\n**Pickup offer:** $${number(offer.quotePerDay)} per weekday, or $${number(offer.quoteCost)} for ${offer.quoteDays} collections, capped at ${number(offer.maxParcelsPerDay)} parcels a day.
