# Authoring examples

Examples are optional guidance, not the default dashboard/report or a second required starter. Keep component examples small and focused on one reusable pattern. Compose the actual application in `src/content/` using the public API described in `../AGENTS.md`.

## Source-backed report prose

```jsx
import { ReportSection, RichNarrative, useDataApp } from "../../data-app-public.jsx";

export function Finding() {
  const { visible, reviewedRows } = useDataApp();
  if (!visible("finding")) return null;
  return <ReportSection id="finding" title="What changed" queryId="observations"
    queryIds={["observations", "context"]}
    sourceRowsByQuery={{ observations: reviewedRows("observations"), context: reviewedRows("context") }}>
    <RichNarrative id="finding:body" value="Write the finding and its limitations here." />
  </ReportSection>;
}
```

Replace the illustrative query IDs and prose with the current artifact's evidence. Use `showHeading={false}` if the Markdown owns its heading. A single-source section needs only `queryId`. Sections, summaries, ordering, metrics, and charts are optional. More substantial report compositions belong in `examples/reports/`, with their own reviewed fixtures and example-specific checks.

## Finished report references

For a focused shared visual pattern, see [chart annotations](components/chart-annotations/README.md).
It runs the same reviewed benchmark, event, range, and point references in a report and a dashboard.

The runnable report in `src/content/report/` is a short operating readout: performance against plan, a reconciled account-growth explanation, and a supported retention follow-up. It is deliberately complete rather than a set of empty headings. Replace it for a different question.

Each reference explains its question, evidence, reasoning, and composition choices. Consult the closest example after deciding what the current analysis needs; borrow useful techniques, not its business story or section list.

- [Adoption and retention operating review](reports/adoption-retention/README.md): a substantial five-source report with executive/technical variants, growth drivers, segment and account diagnostics, and a separately qualified scenario.
- [Activation diagnostic](reports/activation-diagnostics/README.md): a methods-focused report using pooled rates, file-quality checks, an exact rate-versus-mix decomposition, sensitivity checks, and reproducible calculations.
- [Contextual chart annotations](reports/contextual-stories/README.md): three new fictional cases with exact operational, one-time billing, and monitoring-coverage records that add facts absent from the plotted measures.
- [Delivery diagnostic](reports/delivery-diagnostic/README.md): a synthetic business decision with a concise conclusion, competing explanations, chart cards with contextual annotations, expandable evidence, and scoped task links. It uses the report's shared visual defaults rather than a separate demo theme.

The adoption and activation references leave ordinary comparisons unannotated. Use zero annotations when the chart already conveys the finding and no additional sourced context changes its interpretation.
